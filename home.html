            <h3>Latest Project</h3>
            <p> My latest project was creating a functional Website for Mukuru Africa during a hackathon. Our task was to combat the challenges faced by people in rural areas in regards to accessing the Mukuru app, we created a website that has a Google API for translation to help older people who dont understand English. We barely finished the project but we came in 3rd position which i am very proud of. </p>
